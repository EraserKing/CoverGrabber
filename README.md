CoverGrabber
============

Grab cover image, track name/artists/year and lyric from Xiami and write to local files.

Since I bought an iPod Classic, I found it very uncomfortable if there's any album without cover :(
So I wrote this tool to help OCDers, which could fill cover image (and something more) for your local files.
